# ClipFinderBot: The Self-Evolving AI System

ClipFinderBot is the most advanced AI-powered Telegram bot that analyzes short video clips and identifies the **actors**, **scene**, and **source show/movie** using cutting-edge AI technologies. It is built to evolve continuously, integrate with modern AI models, and even write its own code to improve itself over time.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection & Recognition**  
  Uses DeepFace and CLIP to identify actors across frames.

- **Scene Understanding**  
  Leverages image-text models like CLIP and BLIP for scene interpretation.

- **Audio Analysis**  
  Transcribes voice and background audio with OpenAIâ€™s Whisper.

- **Show/Movie Source Identification**  
  Searches matching scenes using FAISS indexing, vector similarity, and internet APIs.

- **GPT-4 Reasoning via API**  
  Uses GPT-4 for intelligent inference, logic, and fallback querying.

- **Autonomous Web Browsing**  
  Searches the web for unknown data via SerpAPI and LangChain tools.

- **Self-Coding & Self-Upgrading AI**  
  Writes, updates, and evolves its own algorithms and strategies autonomously.

- **Multitasking Capabilities**  
  Performs multiple AI tasks in parallel across audio, visual, and text.

- **Zero Human Interference Mode**  
  When activated, the bot runs its full pipeline and decision-making autonomously.
